# ðŸ¤– Robot Arm Control using Arduino

## ðŸ§  Introduction

This project demonstrates how to control a 4-servo robot arm using potentiometers and an Arduino Uno. Each potentiometer controls the angle of a corresponding servo motor, allowing smooth and precise joint movement. This is ideal for learning the basics of servo control, analog input handling, and building a simple robotic arm interface.

## ðŸ’» Code

The Arduino code reads analog values from the potentiometers and maps them to servo angles between 0Â° and 180Â°.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

- Each potentiometer is connected to an analog pin (A0 to A3).
- The servo motors are connected to digital PWM pins (9 to 12).
- The analog value (0â€“1023) is mapped to an angle (0â€“180).
- Servos respond in real time as potentiometer positions change.
